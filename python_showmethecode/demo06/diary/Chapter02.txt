History Of The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire

Edward Gibbon, Esq.

With notes by the Rev. H. H. Milman

Complete Contents

1782 (Written), 1845 (Revised)



There are two Project Gutenberg sets produced by David Reed of the
complete “History Of The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire” by
Edward Gibbon: the 1996 edition (PG #731-736) has the advantage of
including all the foonotes by Gibbon and others; the 1997 edition (PG
#890-895) was provided at that time only in html format and footnotes
were not included in the first five volumes of this set.

Project Gutenberg files #731-736 in the utf-8 charset are the basis of
the present complete edition, #25717.

David Reed’s note in the original Project Gutenberg 1997 edition:
    I want to make this the best etext edition possible for both
    scholars and the general public and would like to thank those who
    have helped in making this text better. Especially Dale R.
    Fredrickson who has hand entered the Greek characters in the
    footnotes and who has suggested retaining the conjoined ae
    character in the text.


A set in my library of the first original First American Edition of
1836 was used as a reference for the many questions which came up
during the re-proofing and renovation of the 1996 and 1997 Project
Gutenberg editions. Images of spines, front-leaf, frontispiece, and the
titlepage of the 1836 set are inserted below along with the two large
fold out maps.
